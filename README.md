Balatro mod which adds ALL pokemon as face card options. There are 1736 new suit skin options, each with a combination of 3 pokemon and a colour setting for the vanilla rank cards. If you use other mods which adds new ranks (eg 0, pi or 21s), you will need to pick a suit option which matches the base game style to fit in with the other mod. 

Every pokemon and most forms are available, in roughly 100 options per suit, each with several sub options. Each option has at least one low contrast version matching the base game, and most have a high contrast version or a reasonably close match. There are also many additional colour choices, largely to match the pokemon or it's type.
There is an extra Random option at the end which randomly selects 4 designs each time you load the game, with at least one guaranteed to match the Low Contrast Mode from the base game. Check it often enough and maybe you'll find a secret option or two. ;)


Future Plans:
No significant additions planned, but I do intend on changing the menu system to be a bit easier to find Pokemon that are on multiple options.
Any feedback will be taken on board. I'll probably make pokemon sizes more uniform eventually, but for now, consider it a feature that you can chose how much of the card the pokemon occupies/covers.



Dependencies and prerequisites required to use this Mod
Lovely (https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)
Steamodded (https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)



Compatability:
This is a purely texture adding mod, compatible with everything as this adds additional options in Options -> Customise Deck.
If you use other mods which adds new ranks (eg 0, pi or 21s), you will need to pick a suit option which matches the base game style to fit in with the other mods additions. 



Installation:

Ensure you have lovely (https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and steamodded (https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) installed correctly.

Download the pokecards.zip file here.

Extract the files into your %Appdata%/Balatro/Mods folder.

Open the game, and new options should be available within Options -> Customise Deck.

OPTIONAL: Feel free to edit the pokecards.lua file to delete entries from the menu. - A version which only keeps 3 stage evos and 'trios' can be found in the discord, but personally I'd just delete the ones I know I won't use. Any entries removed in this way will still sometimes show up in the 'random' option.
